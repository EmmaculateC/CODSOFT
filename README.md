What do we have here?

These are the five projects that I worked on in my CODSOFT Python programming internship in February 2024.

I learned and improved my skills a alot while designing and implementing rockpaperscissors game, crafted a nice ToDoList for varied categories
of day in day out live activities, implemented an amazing password gernerator, designed a simple contact book as well as beatiful calculator.
