What do we have here?

These are the five projects that I have been working on in my CODSOFT Python programming internship in February 2024.

I have learned a alot while designing and implementing rockpaperscissors game, crafted a nice task manager for varied categories
of day in day out live activities, implemented an amazing password gernerator, designed a simple contact book as well as beatiful calculator.

In all these projects, I have explicitly used python programming language.
